### About

This is my personal portfolio and blog website. I have moved from framework to framework... language to language for this site over the years. I have forced myself to settle with Go, it is the most overall proficient language; I will touch more on my Go decision below. this site is meant to show off a range of skills in all things http and allow me to write my thoughts and opinions down somewhere. I am not excepting anyone to read anything here but if you do I hope you enjoy my insanity.
